# mathtoolkit
Basic math extensions and utilities that go beyond Core Java

This was split off from my commonstoolkit as the math stuff isn't used by the rest of that toolkit and isn't needed by some of the others either, so it's best to let it grow on its own, or shrink as the case may be (after I review against Apache Commons Math v4).
